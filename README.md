# Paw Planner

## About The Project

Paw Planner is a web application developed to help pet owners better manage their pets' daily tasks. From feeding and walk reminders to tracking veterinary appointments, Paw Planner aims to simplify the lives of pet owners, allowing them to focus on what truly matters: the well-being and happiness of their pets.

This application was created using React and Vite, offering a fast and responsive user experience, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for more efficient development. Additionally, we've employed ESLint to keep the code clean and standardized.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Firebase (for authentication and data storage)
- SWC (as the JavaScript compiler for Fast Refresh)
- ESLint (for static code analysis)
